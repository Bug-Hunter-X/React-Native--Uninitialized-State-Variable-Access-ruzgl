This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens in functional components before the first render. Consider this example:

```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {count + someValue}</Text> {/* Error here if someValue is not initialized */}
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

If `someValue` is not defined *before* the render, using `count + someValue` will result in an error because `count` might be undefined at the time of the initial render.
